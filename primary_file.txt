					"title of the file : Welcome to git practice set"

This is the first file that I added to my project and I named it "primary_file.txt".

This change I will commit and then I will amend it.

I want to make another change in my file.

This change will be only in new_feature barnch.

I merged master and new_feature branches, and I will merge master and shorten_primary.
